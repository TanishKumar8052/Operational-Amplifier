# Operational-Amplifier
The Aim of this Project is to study the internal structure of the opamp in order to gain deeper insights into its working and how the circuit is synthesized. There are various ICs of opamp available in market like the LM741,TL074,LM1458 etc which are way advanced but the aim of this project is not to create some complex IC design but to understand the various stages of opamp and its parameters in a more simplified manner.<br/>The opamp is widely used in today's world in almost all electronic devices because of its wide range of applications as a filter, as a oscillator,as a amplfiier,as a comparator,as a ADC and for adding, subtracting two signals or for integrating and differentiating signals and the list goes on.<br/>
# Overview of the WorkFlow :
1. Designing the Three Stages of a Opamp
